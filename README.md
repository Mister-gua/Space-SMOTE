To address the issue of low-quality samples introduced by SMOTE and its improvements, we propose a new method called Space-SMOTE. Space-SMOTE treats the region containing the synthesized samples as multiple elongated subspaces and uses the middle samples to determine their spatial quality levels. Subsequently, depending on the spatial quality level, it first selects safe spaces and then selects high-value spaces among the safe spaces. By generating high-value spaces, Space-SMOTE can balance noise control and data-mining tasks.
